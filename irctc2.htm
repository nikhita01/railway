The Indian railway system is operated by the Ministry Of Railways, and is the fourth largest rail service in the world. Being one of the largest system in the world, it has to maintain its facility and services. As we know that any system which runs in today’s world must have on of the following parameter –must be  within cost, must be within time, should have excellent quality, must be best for user satisfaction. The railway system tries to follow the time factor by promising that the customer will reach the destination in time, it follow the cost parameter by promising that the cost to travel from the passenger’s source  to destination would be relevant, it promises to provide on of the best quality trains and seats to the passengers, also it promises to satisfy the passenger’s travel by securing his travel and also by providing it all on his best, so that the passenger is satisfied and allows the railways system to provide same and in fact better service again and again.
Apart from all these facilities the Indian railway provides, there are still some loopholes in the system. As per the current railway system the TATKAL system is one the boon to the society, everything that benefits the society also somewhere is a trouble to the other parts in the society.The Tatkal option, introduced in 1997, is meant for those who at a short notice. Passengers have to pay extra charges for booking tickets under the Tatkal quota. Tatkal tickets can be booked through Railways' Passenger Reservation Centres as well as through internet. As per the system the seats that are reserved for the Tatkal quota are the lower seats and the pre reserved. Also Indian railways promises to provide the senior citizens lower berth facility. After the Tatkal system was introduced the lower seat to the senior citizen doesn’t always work as it should.
The system defined here works to, not completely avoid the Tatkal system but to provide senior citizens the lower berth facilities. The reserved Tatkal seats could simply be one or two compartment seats and the lowers could be provided at first to the senior citizens and not simply by the berth preference. Also by this system the berth swapping could be made easier, when people travelling with the seniors one have to keep on asking people in lower berth to settle up at the elder one’s. They could simply use this system to communicate with the ticket collector of the train or directly the railway staff to modify the berth.
